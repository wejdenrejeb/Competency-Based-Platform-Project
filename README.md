# Competency-Based Platform Project

This project consists of five notebooks, each detailing a crucial step in the process of creating a Competency-Based Platform. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

    LinkedIn Data Scraping: The project commences with scraping data from LinkedIn profiles. It includes extracting relevant information that can be used for our competency analysis.

    Data Preprocessing: After scraping the data, we perform a series of preprocessing tasks to clean and structure the data. This step ensures the data is in a suitable form for further analysis.

    Skills Extraction with SkillNer: In this phase, we utilize the SkillNer model to extract skills from the preprocessed data. SkillNer is a robust tool that accurately identifies and extracts skills information from textual data.

    Data Classification with OpenAI: The extracted skills data is then classified into distinct categories using OpenAI. This step enhances the interpretability of our results, facilitating efficient analysis and decision-making.

    PDF Data Extraction and Skills Matching: Lastly, the project includes a notebook detailing how to extract data from PDF files and subsequently apply the SkillNer model to this data for skills extraction. The final process involves matching the scraped skills with the skills extracted from PDFs.

Each notebook in the project provides a detailed explanation of the individual processes and the respective codes used. This ensures that the project is easy to understand and follow, enabling efficient execution and modification.

Please remember to use the data responsibly, abiding by all relevant terms of use and privacy regulations.
