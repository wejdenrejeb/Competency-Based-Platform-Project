# Competency-Based-Platform
## For the deployment of this application, we utilized Flask and MongoDB to establish a robust and high-performance web application. Here's a walkthrough of our application:
### Account Creation and Login
Start by creating an account. Once you've successfully registered, you can log in using your account credentials
### Data Access
As a user, you will be able to view the collected data and information about required skills in various fields. This provides a comprehensive understanding of the current market demands in terms of competencies
### Interactive Dashboard
The application features a Power BI dashboard, offering key insights into the skills landscape. It displays metrics like frequency of each skill per specialty, companies hiring the most in each specialty, and statistics on the skills being taught at ESPRIT. Additionally, it features a chart showcasing the variation in the utilization of each competency over the years
### PDF Files Import and Skills Analysis
Another feature allows you to import PDF files and identify the skills mentioned within these documents. This tool also provides a list of missing skills that could be beneficial additions to the documents
By offering these functionalities, our application serves as a powerful tool for professionals looking to understand and navigate the competency landscape better.
